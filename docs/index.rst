formaldict
==========

``formaldict`` provides the constructs for parsing structured dictionaries
that adhere to a schema. Along with a simple and flexible schema definition
to parse and validate dictionaries, ``formaldict`` is integrated with
`python-prompt-toolkit <https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit>`__.
This integration allows users to easily construct flows for command line
interfaces (CLIs) when parsing structured user input.

Below is an example user input flow constructed with a ``formaldict``
schema:
