# formaldict

`formaldict` provides the constructs for parsing structured dictionaries that adhere to a schema. Along with a simple and flexible schema definition to parse and validate dictionaries, `formaldict` is integrated with [python-prompt-toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit). This integration allows users to easily construct flows for command line interfaces (CLIs) when parsing structured user input.

Below is an example user input flow constructed with a `formaldict` schema:
